# Unfinished World

## A Game of Existential Exploration

"Unfinished World" is a narrative-driven, choice-based exploration game inspired by existentialist philosophy and multi-author literature. Grapple with meaning, choice, and absurdity in a surreal, ever-changing world where your decisions shape not only your character's journey but the very fabric of reality.

## Core Themes

*   **The Absurd:** Embrace the inherent meaninglessness of existence.
*   **Freedom & Responsibility:** Every choice has irreversible, meaningful consequences.
*   **Authenticity:** Define your own purpose in a world without clear external goals.
*   **Mortality & Time:** Experience the relentless passage of time and the decay of the world around you.
*   **Eternal Recurrence:** Confront the possibility of reliving your life infinitely.

## Gameplay

*   **Exploration:** Traverse abstract, shifting landscapes that reflect your character's mindset.
*   **Decision-Making:** Navigate complex dialogues and actions where choices are never explicitly "good" or "bad."
*   **Reflection:** Record your evolving philosophy in a "Mind Journal," which subtly alters the game world.
*   **Consequence:** Shape your unique ending based on the meaning you construct throughout your journey.

## Inspired By

*   **Philosophers:** Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche
*   **Authors:** Franz Kafka, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Virginia Woolf, and more.

## Tech Stack

*   **Game Engine/Server:** Node.js with TypeScript
*   **Frontend:** Next.js with TypeScript
*   **Code Sharing:** TypeScript types and utility functions shared between server and client
*   **Automated Testing:** Jest
*   **Code Formatting:** Prettier
*   **Linting:** ESLint
